# mnist_classification
In this notebook we develop a least squares model that will classify handwritten digits. This is a task more suited to convolutional neural networks. In fact such networks have been shown to have a 99% accuracy rate. Our aim is to demonstrate that this classification can be accomplished using a simple least squares model. Also this exercise will afford us a better understanding of the least squares method of building models. We will demonstrate that an accuracy rate of near 88% can be achieved using this method.
